# CLB

Welcome to the CLB! (Pronounced /kl åb/).

CLB is in its early development stage and the next generation of
[PSM library](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutus-simple-model).

The undergoing development is funded by Catalyst Fund 10 [project]
(https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1000121).
Milestone reports are available in [`docs/reports`]
(https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/clb/tree/master/docs/reports).

See `test/smoke/smoke-test.hs` for a usage example.

# Development

Currently, we use `input-output-hk/devx` shell with `cabal`:

```bash
$ cd clb
$ direnv allow
$ cabal run smoke-test
```
